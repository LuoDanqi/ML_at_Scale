    "Welcome to Machine Learning at Scale! This first homework assignment introduces one of the core strategies in distributed processing: divide and conquer. We'll use the simplest of tasks, word counting, to illustrate the difference between a scalable and non-scalable algorithm. You will be working with the text of _Alice in Wonderland_ to put these ideas into practice using Python and Bash scripting. By the end of this week you should be able to:\n",
    "* ... __describe__ the Bias-Variance tradeoff as it applies to Machine Learning.\n",
    "* ... __explain__ why we consider word counting to be an \"Embarrassingly Parallel\" task.\n",
    "* ... __estimate__ the runtime of embarrassingly parallel tasks using \"back of the envelope\" calculations.\n",
    "* ... __implement__ a Map Reduce algorithm using the Command Line.\n",
    "* ... __set-up__ a Docker container and know why we use them for this course.\n",

For example, you might choose to remove punctuation or to consider punctuation symbols  'tokens' in their own right. __In this question you'll use the Python `re` module to create a tokenizer to use when you perform WordCount on the _Alice In Wonderland_ text.__\n",

As we knew from part a below, n = 3019 , so the total comparision will be 4555671 times\n",
    "\n",
    "> __b)__ If the document is sorted already, then we can only compare with the next word instead of scanning through the entire file. In the worst case scenario, no plurals will be merged, every word will be compared with the next word, there will only be $n-1$ times of comparison. The complexity of the algorithm will be $O(n)$. As we knew from part a below, n = 3019 , so the total comparision will be 3018 times.\n",
    "\n",
    "> __c)__ The fastest sorting algorithm is merge sort and the Big O complexity is $O(nlogn)$. It totally make sense to aphabetize before combining singular-plural pairs, since sorting-$O(nlogn)$ is higher than combining-$O(n)$, the total time will still be $O(nlogn)$ which is way faster than $O(n^2)$ as the n gets bigger. \n"

    "# Question 7: Parallel Word Count (part 2)\n",
    "Congratulations, you've just implemented a Map-Reduce algorithm! From here on out, we'll refer to the two python scripts you passed to `pWordCount_v1.sh` as '_mapper_' and '_reducer_'. The bash script itself served as our '_framework_' -- it split up the original input, then ___mapped___ our word counting script on to each chunk, then ___aggregated (a.k.a. reduced)___ the resulting files by piping them into our collation script.  Unfortunately, as you may have realized already, there is a major scalability concern with this particular implementation. __In this question you'll fix our implementation of parallel word count so that it will be scalable.__\n",
    "\n",
    "__HINT:__ MapReduce uses the Merge-Sort algorithm under the hood. Linux `sort` command has a merge option which you can use to simiulate the MapReduce framework. Use the `man sort` command to find more information on this option. \n",

    "### Q7 Tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "* __a) short response:__ What is the potential scalability problem with the provided implementation of `aggregateCounts_v1.py`? Explain why this supposedly 'parallelized' Word Count wouldn't work on a really large input corpus.  [`HINT:` _see the intro to Q6_]\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* __b) code:__ Fortunately, a 'strategic sort' can solve this problem. Read the instructions at the top of `pWordCount_v2.sh` carefully then make your changes that alphabetically sort the output from the mappers (`countfiles`) before piping them into the reducer script.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* __c) code:__ Write the main part of `aggregateCounts_v2.py` so that it takes advantage of the sorted input to add duplicate counts without storing the whole vocabulary in memory. Refer to the file docstring for more detailed instructions. Confirm that your implementation works by running it on both the test and true data files.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* __d) short response:__ If you are paying close attention, this rewritten reducer sets us up for a truly scalable solution, but doesn't get us all the way there. In particular, while we chunked our data so it can be processed by multiple mappers, we're still streaming the entire dataset through one reduce script. If the vocabulary is too large to fit on a single computer, we might split the word counts in half after sorting them, then perform the reducing on two separate machines. Explain what could go wrong with this approach. (For now, ignore the question of how we'd sort a dataset that is too large to fit on a single machine and just focus on what might be wrong about the result of this split-in-half reducing).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* __e) short response:__ Can you come up with a different way of splitting up the data that would allow us to perform the reducing on separate machines without needing any postprocessing? This is a theoretical question -- don't worry if you don't know how to implement your idea in a bash script, just describe how you'd want to split the sorted counts into different files to be reduced separately."

    "> __a)__ With all the parallelized word count chunk unsorted and piped them all into the reducer, it can deal with running time concerns. However, the parallelized count dictionaries exists in memory on the machine running this notebook with even more duplicated keys and values when the 4 large dictionaries were merged into 1 file. \n",
    "\n",
    "> __b-c)__ _complete the coding portions of this question before answering d and e._\n",
    "\n",
    "> __d)__ First, if we store all the data chunks into one word count file and then sort them on one machine before splitting into two reducer machines, we might still face the problem of having one word count file being too large for the RAM. \n",
    "\n",
    ">\tSecond, even if we have two sorted word count files in two reducers, how the keys being separate into two machines could potentially be a problem. Since the word count file is sorted, I assume the file will be cut into half and half, but if the cutting point accidentally cut the plural pairs or the same keys, i.e, \"queen\" and \"queens\" into two different files or 4 \"alice\" keys cut into two files, then the output will have two un-reduced mistakes.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "> __e)__ I would extract the *unique* keys from the word count dictionary , then separate the keys into two different reducers instead of simply cutting them into half. Or at the splitting point, check the next key word, see if it is different to the spliting point key. For example, if we split n lines of word counts file into half, the middle point of the n/2-th word is \"queen\", I will check the next word and see if it is the same \"queen\" or plural form  \"queens\"; if it is true, then move the splitting point one more until the next word is different."

    "# Question 8: Scalability Considerations\n",
    "In your reading for Week 1's live session, [Chapter1, section 2](https://lintool.github.io/MapReduceAlgorithms/MapReduce-book-final.pdf) of _Data Intensive Text Processing with MapReduce_, Lin and Dyer discuss a number of \"Big Ideas\" that underlie large scale processing: __scale \"out,\" not \"up\"; assume failures are common; move processing to the data; process data sequentially and avoid random access; hide system-level details from the application developer; and seamless scalability.__ Part of our work this semester will be to interact with these ideas in a practical way, not just a conceptual one.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q8 Tasks:\n",
    "* __a) short response:__ What do Lin and Dyer consider the two features of an \"ideal algorithm\" from a scalability perspective?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* __b) short response:__ The mapper script below (created on the fly using a little Jupyter magic) will help us illustrate the concept of scalability. Run the provided code which passes this mapper script to our parallel computation 'framework' and runs the 'analysis' on the _Alice_ text file. Note that we've omitted a reducer for simplicity. What do you observe about the time it takes to run this \"algorithm\" when we use 1, 2 and 4 partitions? Does it meet Lin and Dyer's criteria?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* __c) short response:__ Let's try something similar with your Word Count analysis. Run the provided code to time your implementation with 1, 2, 4 and 8 partitions. What do you observe about the runtimes? Does this match your expectation? Speculate about why we might be seeing these times. What conclusions should we draw about the scalability of our implementation? [`HINT:` _consider the limitations of both your machine and our implementation... there are some competing forces at work, what are they?_]\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* __d) OPTIONAL:__ Which components of your Map-Reduce algorithm are affected by a change in the number of partitions? Does increasing the number of partitions increase or decrease the total time spent on each of these portions of the task? What tradeoff does this cause?"

    "\n",
    "> __a)__ First is Data: given twice the amount of data, the same algorithm should take at most twice as long to run. Second is Resources: given a cluster twice the size, the same algorithm should take no more than half as long to run. \n",
    "\n",
    "> __b)__ It almost is an \"ideal algorithm\" but not technically \"ideal\", when we split the file and pass them into the mappers, which is basically counting lines, the running time is reduced slightly above half. Theoretically, the mapper complexity is big $O(n)$, when split into $2^n$ files and run parallelly, the time should be reduced by $2^n$ times.\n",
    "\n",
    "> __c)__ We see the time is almost the same with 1, 2, 8 partitions and time goes up with 16, 32 partitions. At the begining, I would think the time should goes down like the previous one, since the algorithm of reducer is also big $O(n)$ in terms of time complexity after every word is sorted. However, when we split the file, and each file count the words parallelly in mapper, the merged file will have more and more duplicated words as we have more temporary word count files. Therefore, it costs more running time to reduce. When we have 1, 2, 8 partitions, the time we saved on partition word counting is almost cancelled with the time with reducing the duplicated words; when we have 16 or 32 partitions, the time we saved is less then time in reducing.\n",
    "The conculsion is there will be a partition number for our implementation, more time we saved on mapping, more time will be spent on reducing, similar to the bias variance trade off.\n",
    "\n",
    "> __d)__ As explained on Q.8c, both mapping and reducing are affected by a change in the number of partitions. More time we saved on mapping, more time will be spent on reducing, similar to the bias variance trade off."

    "> __a)__ Embarrassingly Parallel can also be called 'Perfectly Parallel', and describes a task that can be perfectly decomposed into independent subtasks for which there is no dependency or need for communication between the subtasks or the results stemming from them. For word counting case, each counting mapper in each individual parition does not depend on any other partitions count aspect, and no communication is between paritions is required. The term \"Embarrassingly Parallel\" describes the implementation of a task in my opinion, as implementattion of parallel counting is the approach to tackle a task and a task itself can be considered broad.\n",
    "\n",
    "> __b)__ Associative means that groupings do not matter: (a+b)+c = a+(b+c). Commutative means that order does not matter: a+b+c = a+c+b. Together, this implies that each component a, b, and c, as well as any groupings or orderings of those components, can be computed independently of each other. When aggregated or *combined* at the end, the result is still the same. A task executed in a manner that exhibits both commutative and associative operations would be said to be embarrassingly parallel."
