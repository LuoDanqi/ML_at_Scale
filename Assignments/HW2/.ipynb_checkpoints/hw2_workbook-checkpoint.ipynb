    "\n",
    "> __a)__ Hadoop MapReduce is a programmming paradigm that was designed to allow parallel distributed processing of large set of data and combining and reduceing to a smaller set. The main idea of this paradigm is mapping and reducing, given a list, map takes as an argument a function  𝑓  to be applied to all elements of the list; given a list, fold (i.e. reduce) takes as arguments a function  𝑔  and an initial value, which are applied to all items in the list, collapsing itemsto produce a final value.\n",
    "\n",
    "> __b)__ Hadoop Shuffle is the heart of MapReduce, which performs the sort and transfers the map outputs to the reducers and guarantee that the input to every reducer is sorted by key. It happens after the map and before the reduce job. The sorting part is costly in both time and space when we have all the outputs from each mapper on the memory or disk. The in-map combiner or local aggregation could significantly save the size of output data from mapper.\n",
    "\n",
    "> __c)__ The reducer is expected to recieve the output data from mapper, the combiner is an optional function, which means combiners might or might not be used in Hadoop. Therefore, if the data format of mapper's output and reducer's input is set, the combiner must not change the input and output record format in order to keep the orignial process going. \n",
    "\n",
    "> __d)__ In Hadoop Streaming jobs, we can specify the block size and task number (# of maps per node, # of reducers per node). For the # of maps, this can be set via mapred.map.tasks; a lower bound on split size can be set via mapred.min.split.size. # of maps can be set manually via JobConf's conf.setNumMapTasks, which can be used to increase, but not decrease below Hadoop's determined #. Reducers can be increase (limited upwards at ~1000 by the buffer size), and can be changed manually in the same way as the mapper: JobConf's conf.setNumReduceTasks(int num).\n",
    "\n",
    "> __e)__ The data volume is growing faster than the storage space, also the processing power and bandwidth is limiting fast process large volume of data. This motivates the creation of parallel processing like MapReduce and other framworks. The programmers only need to implement the mapper, the reducer and optionally, the combiner and the partitioner. All other aspects of execution are handled transparently by the execution framework."

    "> __a)__ Counters in Hadoop Streaming are used to keep track of the number of occurrences of any event. Default counters include MapReduce Task Counters (e.g. # of input_records and output records for each map / reduce tasks), FileSystem Counters (e.g. # of bytes read and written by map / reduce tasks), FileInputFormat Counters (e.g. bytes read by map tasks via FileInputFormat), FileOutputFormat Counters (# of bytes written by map / reduce tasks via FileOutputFormat), MapReduce Job Counters (e.g. job-level statistics, such as # of map tasks launched over course of job, including those that failed, time elapsed, etc). Custom counters can be coded by the uservia Java enum. \n",
    "\n",
    "> __b)__ The composite keys are a new set of keys created based on multiple intermediate keys. It is very helpful for second sorting jobs when we have two or more set of keys needs to be sorted. We must also implement a custom partitioner so that all pairs associated with the same sensor are shuffled to the same reducer.\n",
    "\n",
    "> __c)__ The order inversion pattern is '*\\<text\\>'. It helps solve to enable parallelism, efficiency, and scalability in computing totals and relative frequencies (as well as, presumably, any other aggregate functions that need to be applied to the data set). Alternatives face issue with limited memory via the use of a single reducer, and / or lower efficiency required by passing through the data twice via sequential MapReduce processes. It utilizes MapReduce's inherent shuffle & sort behavior to force specific fields to the top of the list, enabling Reducing of the aggregate value first, to be known ahead of time to compute subsequent calculations. In general, it should be implemented with custom partitioning, by appending an additional key to leverage default partitioning behavior of the framework to emit totals multiple times, once to each reducer. This way, each reducer knows the full aggregate value by reducing across all aggregate line items. \n"

    "# Question 3: Understanding Total Order Sort\n",
    "\n",
    "The key challenge in distributed computing is to break a problem into a set of sub-problems that can be performed without communicating with each other. Ideally, we should be able to define an arbirtary number of splits and still get the right result, but that is not always possible. Parallelization becomes particularly challenging when we need to make comparisons between records, for example when sorting. Total Order Sort allows us to order large datasets in a way that enables efficient retrieval of results. Before beginning this assignment, make sure you have read and understand the [Total Order Sort Notebook](https://github.com/UCB-w261/main/tree/master/HelpfulResources/TotalSortGuide/_total-sort-guide-spark2.01-JAN27-2017.ipynb). You can skip the first two MRJob sections, but the rest of section III and all of section IV are **very** important (and apply to Hadoop Streaming) so make sure to read them closely. Feel free to read the Spark sections as well but you won't be responsible for that material until later in the course. To verify your understanding, answer the following questions.\n",

    "> __a)__ A partial sort sorts key-value records within each partition file based on the key, and is default behavior. An unordered total sort orders all values across all partitions based on a single key, requiring all partitions to be stacked to generate a total ordering. A total order sort is the same as total unordered sort, but requires that partition file names also be assigned an order. Total order sort allows us to move sequentially through partitions to identify specific items based on value / key rankings. This is not possible with unordered total. This is important from an efficiency standpoint / perspective for large datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "> __b)__ Map / Partition phases are needed; a partition file or partition function needs to be included in the mapper to generate a specific partition key that will help override the default within-partition sorting of Hadoop MapReduce. More specifically, one needs to override the default shuffle behavior by providing a custom partitioner(partition key), a custom sort specification (e.g., numeric/alphanumeric increasing/decreasing), and a combiner. Note that a combiner is not required for a total order sort but makes the MapReduce job more efficient. This needs to be changed because the default sort behavior is a partial sort.\n",

Then describe in words how you would go about printing the top 10 words in each class given this sorted output. (`HINT 1:` _remember that you can simply pass the `part a` output directory to the input field of this job; `HINT 2:` since this task is just reodering the records from `part a` we don't need to write a mapper or reducer, just use `/bin/cat` for both_)\n",

Rewrite your job from ` part d` to specify 2 reduce tasks and to tell Hadoop to partition based on the second field (which indicates spam/ham in our data). Your code should maintain the secondary sort -- that is each partition should list words from most to least frequent."

We can get both values by counting the number of each token $t_k$ for both class 1 and 0 to get the conditional probability; and get the $\\hat{P}(c)$ by counting the class 1 and class 2 document numbers over the total document numbers. Ideally, we can retrieve this information for all classes and all words by one pass over the data.\n",

In the textbook's Example, we see the classification will be 1 since there are 3 chineses and only 2 japanese related words appeared in the testing set and Chinese weight should be higher than the Japanese weight. The +1 smoothing can make sure that the probability will not be 0 even if the words in testing set did not appear in training set, therefore, it can predict the answer correctly. \n"

    "# Question 7: Naive Bayes Inference.\n",
    "In the next two questions you'll write code to parallelize the Naive Bayes calculations that you performed above. We'll do this in two phases: one MapReduce job to perform training and a second MapReduce to perform inference. While in practice we'd need to train a model before we can use it to classify documents, for learning purposes we're going to develop our code in the opposite order. By first focusing on the pieces of information/format we need to perform the classification (inference) task you should find it easier to develop a solid implementation for training phase when you get to question 8 below. In both of these questions we'll continue to use the Chinese example corpus from the textbook to help us test our MapReduce code as we develop it. Below we've reproduced the corpus, test set and model in text format that matches the Enron data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q7 Tasks:\n",
    "* __a) short response:__ run the provided cells to create the example files and load them in to HDFS. Then take a closer look at __`NBmodel.txt`__. This text file represents a Naive Bayes model trained (with Laplace +1 smoothing) on the example corpus. What are the 'keys' and 'values' in this file? Which record means something slightly different than the rest? The value field of each record includes two numbers which will be helpful for debugging but which we don't actually need to perform inference -- what are they? [`HINT`: _This file represents the model from Example 13.1 in the textbook, if you're having trouble getting oriented try comparing our file to the numbers in that example._]\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* __b) short response:__ When performing Naive Bayes in practice instead of multiplying the probabilities (as in equation 13.3) we add their logs (as in equation 13.4). Why do we choose to work with log probabilities? If we had an unsmoothed model, what potential error could arise from this transformation?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* __c) short response:__ Documents 6 and 8 in the test set include a word that did not appear in the training corpus (and as a result does not appear in the model). What should we do at inference time when we need a class conditional probability for this word?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* __d) short response:__ The goal of our MapReduce job is to stream over the test set and classify each document by peforming the calculation from equation 13.4. To do this we'll load the model file (which contains the probabilities for equation 13.4) into memory on the nodes where we do our mapping. This is called an in-memory join. Does loading a model 'state' like this depart from the functional programming principles? Explain why or why not. From a scability perspective when would this kind of memory use be justified? when would it be unwise?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* __e) code:__ Complete the code in __`NaiveBayes/classify_mapper.py`__. Read the docstring carefully to understand how this script should work and the format it should return. Run the provided unit tests to confirm that your script works as expected then write a Hadoop streaming job to classify the Chinese example test set. [`HINT 1:` _you shouldn't need a reducer for this one._ `HINT 2:` _Don't forget to add the model file to the_ `-files` _parameter in your Hadoop streaming job so that it gets shipped to the mapper nodes where it will be accessed by your script._]\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* __f) short response:__ In our test example and in the Enron data set we have fairly short documents. Since these fit fine in memory on a mapper node we didn't need a reducer and could just do all of our calculations in the mapper. However with much longer documents (eg. books) we might want a higher level of parallelization -- for example we might want to process parts of a document on different nodes. In this hypothetical scenario how would our algorithm design change? What could the mappers still do? What key-value structure would they emit? What would the reducers have to do as a last step?"

    "### Q7 Student Answers:\n",
    "> __a)__ For each row, the word is the key; the first value is the number of the token appeared in class 0, the second value is the number of the token appeared in class 1;The third value is the conditional probaibility with +1 smoothing of the token appeared in class 0, the last value is the conditional probaibility with +1 smoothing of the token appeared in class 1. The number count is helpful for debugging but we don't actually need to perform inference\n",
    "\n",
    "> __b)__ The log probabilities can prevent result in a floating point underflow since most of the conditional probabilities are small. If we did not use smoothed model, the value of log(0) will be invalid. \n",
    "\n",
    "> __c)__ We should give the count as 0 but add 1 as smoothing for both classes for calculating the weights.\n",
    "\n",
    "> __d)__ Yes, loading the model files is different to the functional programming principles. Because it changes the in state that do not depend on the function inputs. The in-memory join is potentially a problem to scability but it could be much faster if we calcualte things and join them in RAM, and RAM is relatively cheap to expand.\n",
    "\n",
    "> __e)__ Complete the coding portion of this question before answering 'f'.\n",
    "\n",
    "> __f)__ If we need to parallelize the mapper process, then we will need to add a total count key in order to calcualte the probabilities; and the total count will need to be at the begining of all the keys as *total. The key-value structure will be similar except for the *total key, where we have the count for each word in two classes. In the reducer, we will need to sum the *total key first so that we can calculate the conditional probabilities as well as the prior probabilities. \n"

    "# Question 8: Naive Bayes Training.\n",
    "In Question 7 we used a model that we had trained by hand. Next we'll develop the code to do that same training in parallel, making it suitable for use with larger corpora (like the Enron emails). The end result of the MapReduce job you write in this question should be a model text file that looks just like the example (`NBmodel.txt`) that we created by hand above.\n",
    "\n",
    "To refresh your memory about the training process take a look at  `6a` and `6b` where you described the pieces of information you'll need to collect in order to encode a Multinomial Naive Bayes model. We now want to retrieve those pieces of information while streaming over a corpus. The bulk of the task will be very similar to the word counting excercises you've already done but you may want to consider a slightly different key-value record structure to efficiently tally counts for each class. \n",
    "\n",
    "The most challenging (interesting?) design question will be how to retrieve the totals (# of documents and # of words in documents for each class). Of course, counting these numbers is easy. The hard part is the timing: you'll need to make sure you have the counts totalled up _before_ you start estimating the class conditional probabilities for each word. It would be best (i.e. most scalable) if we could find a way to do this tallying without storing the whole vocabulary in memory... Use an appropriate MapReduce design pattern to implement this efficiently! \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q8 Tasks:\n",
    "* __a) make a plan:__  Fill in the docstrings for __`NaiveBayes/train_mapper.py`__ and __`NaiveBayes/train_reducer.py`__ to appropriately reflect the format that each script will input/output. [`HINT:` _the input files_ (`enronemail_1h.txt` & `chineseTrain.txt`) _have a prespecified format and your output file should match_ `NBmodel.txt` _so you really only have to decide on an internal format for Hadoop_].\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* __b) implement it:__ Complete the code in __`NaiveBayes/train_mapper.py`__ and __`NaiveBayes/train_reducer.py`__ so that together they train a Multinomial Naive Bayes model __with no smoothing__. Make sure your end result is formatted correctly (see note above). Test your scripts independently and together (using `chineseTrain.txt` or test input of your own devising). When you are satisfied with your Python code design and run a Hadoop streaming command to run your job in parallel on the __chineseTrain.txt__. Confirm that your trained model matches your hand calculations from Question 5.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* __c) short response:__ We saw in Question 6 that adding Laplace +1 smoothing makes our classifications less sensitve to rare words. However implementing this technique requires access to one additional piece of information that we had not previously used in our Naive Bayes training. What is that extra piece of information? [`HINT:` see equation 13.7 in Manning, Raghavan and Schutze].\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* __d) short response:__ There are a couple of approaches that we could take to handle the extra piece of information you identified in `c`: 1) if we knew this extra information beforehand, we could provide it to our reducer as a configurable parameter for the vocab size dynamically (_where would we get it in the first place?_). Or 2) we could compute it in the reducer without storing any bulky information in memory but then we'd need some postprocessing or a second MapReduce job to complete the calculation (_why?_). Breifly explain what is non-ideal about each of these options. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* __e) code + short response:__ Choose one of the 2 options above. State your choice & reasoning in the space below then use that strategy to complete the code in __`NaiveBayes/train_reducer_smooth.py`__. Test this alternate reducer then write and run a Hadoop streaming job to train an MNB model with smoothing on the Chinese example. Your results should match the model that we provided for you above (and the calculations in the textbook example). __IMPORTANT NOTE:__ For full credit on this question, your code must work with multiple reducers. \n",

    "> __ c)__ We will need to know the B', which is the number of terms in the vocabulary, in the chineseTrain.txt, it will be 6 different words.\n",
    "\n",
    "> __ d)__ For approach 1, we can modify the existing reducer and mapper to count the unique key counts in the first MapReduce job, so it pass the output to the reducer and re-calculate the relative frequencies with vocabulary parameter. For approach 2, we weill need to do a seperate MapReduce, so we can get it by adding a dictionary to store the count and keys. Then do a total word count and unique keys count at the Reduce stage from different partitions. The second approach is not ideal since it requires extra storage and two MapReduce jobs. \n",
    "\n",
    "> __ e)__ I choose the first option, since the vocabulary size is normally not static in practice and the partition also seperated words and make sure there will be no redundent words in reducers, so it will be better to modify the mapper and calculate it in the reduce stage."

    "* __a) train/test split:__ Run the provided code to split our Enron file into a training set and testing set then load them into HDFS. [`NOTE:` _Make sure you re calculate the vocab size for just the training set!_]\n",
    "\n",
    "* __b) train 2 models:__ Write Hadoop Streaming jobs to train MNB Models on the training set with and without smoothing. Save your models to local files at __`NaiveBayes/Unsmoothed/NBmodel.txt`__ and __`NaiveBayes/Smoothed/NBmodel.txt`__. [`NOTE:` _This naming is important because we wrote our classification task so that it expects a file of that name... if this inelegance frustrates you there is an alternative that would involve a few adjustments to your code [read more about it here](http://www.tnoda.com/blog/2013-11-23)._] Finally run the checks that we provide to confirm that your results are correct.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* __c) code:__ Recall that we designed our classification job with just a mapper. An efficient way to report the performance of our models would be to simply add a reducer phase to this job and compute precision and recall right there. Complete the code in __`NaiveBayes/evaluation_reducer.py`__ and then write Hadoop jobs to evaluate your two models on the test set. Report their performance side by side. [`NOTE:` if you need a refresher on precision, recall and F1-score [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F1_score) is a good resource.]\n",

    "* __a) code + short response:__ Let's look at the top ten words with the highest conditional probability in `Spam` and in `Ham`. We'll do this by writing a Hadoop job that sorts the model file (`NaiveBayes/Smoothed/NBmodel.py`). Normally we'd have to run two jobs -- one that sorts on $P(word|ham)$ and another that sorts on $P(word|spam)$. However if we slighly modify the data format in the model file then we can get the top words in each class with just one job. We've written a mapper that will do just this for you. Read through __`NaiveBayes/model_sort_mapper.py`__ and then briefly explain how this mapper will allow us to partition and sort our model file. Write a Hadoop job that uses our mapper and `/bin/cat` for a reducer to partition and sort. Print out the top 10 words in each class (where 'top' == highest conditional probability).[`HINT:` _this should remind you a lot of what we did in Question 6._]\n",

    "\n",
    "* __b) short response:__ What do you notice about the 'top words' we printed in `a`? How would increasing the smoothing parameter 'k' affect the probabilities for the top words that you identified for 'a'. How would they affect the probabilities of words that occur much more in one class than another? In summary, how does the smoothing parameter 'k' affect the bias and the variance of our model. [`NOTE:` _you do not need to code anything for this task, but if you are struggling with it you could try changing 'k' and see what happens to the test set. We don't recommend doing this exploration with the Enron data because it will be harder to see the impact with such a big vocabulary_]"
